# TLDHunt - Domain Availability Checker
TLDHunt is a command-line tool designed to help users find available domain names for their online projects or businesses. By providing a keyword and a list of TLD (top-level domain) extensions, TLDHunt checks the availability of domain names that match the given criteria. This tool is particularly useful for those who want to quickly find a domain name that is not already taken, without having to perform a manual search on a domain registrar website.

For red teaming or phishing purposes, this tool can help you to find similar domains with different extensions from the original domain.

# Dependencies
This tool is written in Bash and the only dependency required is **whois**. Therefore, make sure that you have installed whois on your system. In Debian, you can install whois using the following command:
```
sudo apt install whois -y
```

# How It Works?
To detect whether a domain is registered or not, we search for the words "**Name Server**" in the output of the WHOIS command, as this is a signature of a registered domain. If you have a better signature or detection method, please feel free to submit a pull request.

# Domain Extension List
You can use your custom tlds.txt list, but make sure that it is formatted like this:

```
.aero
.asia
.biz
.cat
.com
.coop
.info
.int
.jobs
.mobi
```
